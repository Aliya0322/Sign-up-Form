# Sign-up form (HTML/CSS)

This project features a simple, responsive sign-up form created using HTML and CSS. The form is designed to collect user information such as name, email, and password.

## Key features of the project:

+ Custom Font: The form uses the Norse-Bold.otf font to provide a unique, bold typographic style.
+ Interactive Input Fields:
   - When a user clicks or focuses on an input field, the border turns blue to indicate the active state.
   - If the user enters an invalid format (e.g., an incorrectly formatted email or password), the border turns red to highlight the error and guide the user toward fixing the input.
